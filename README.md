FUN FACT
</span> 
<br/>

- I Literally imagine and visualise each component of a program as small minions carrying out their individual task and resposibility in a factory, i’ve literally been able to discover a lot of bugs using this trick.. it helps me a lot especially in OOP based programs, you should try it.
- I don’t work under pressure, so please don’t pressure me
